# Pomodoro App
Built using React.js

## Description

I built this Pomodoro timer app to help me deepen my understanding of both JavaScript and React.js and to practice my CSS flex skills. The HTML is very minimal as my React code, housed in the .js file, does all the heavy lifting of rendering HTML from JSX. A variety of functions are built into the React code to determine the logic of the app, govern which buttons can be pressed at what times, and manage the countdowns. The background color shifts to indicate whether you are currently in a session or a break, and a bell rings when it's time to switch.

## Getting Started

You can find my original files in /dev_files/app, and the root files are copied over from /dev_files/build. I commented fairly extensively throughout the files, but please let me know if you have any questions.

# Depencies

* React
* ReactDOM
* Babel
* Webpack

(The last two are used to convert the JSX and ES6 from the React code.)
